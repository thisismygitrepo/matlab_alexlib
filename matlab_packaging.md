# Rules

* Put your code in a repo. It can be a git repo as well.
* From the upper banner, chose create a package.
* The packaging process *must* take place inside a different folder.
* The new packaging folder will contain

    * Final product (package .mtlbx)
    * Project to manage (regenerate or edit) the final product and its details
      It holds reference to where the code came from and contains details about publisher.

* The package manager (.prj) should be used to regenerate new releases.
* From package manager (.prj) you can either, publish or publish and share.
* If it is the not the first time to sharem then it behoves you to go to matlabcentral.com and click update on the package already published
  and upload the new package, otherwise, the new version will be published separately.

* You can either install the package locally by fetching the online version, or, install the local .mtlbx (better and quicker for testing).
